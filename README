About the Fermentation Station

This is nothing more than a personal site that I am developing for home use. I plan to track and view fermentation temperatures for beer and wine (home brewing). This project is also a fun way to learn some web development, mySQL, PHP, and who knows what else. If you come across this site and find anything useful, please feel free to use it...or whatever. 

Thanks.
